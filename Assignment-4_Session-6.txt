Problem Statement:

Use the given link Data Set.

Answer the following questions:

a. What are the assumptions of ANOVA, test it out?
Answer-
# The Assumptions of ANOVA test is as mentioned below with the test performed:

# 1. Errors are independent :- The sample sizes need not be the same, though it’s best if they’re not very different.

# 2. Errors(residual) are normally distributed.

# 3. Variances are homogeneous.

# 4. Models effects are addictive.

# Bartlett Test of Homogeneity of Variances

# Figner-Killeen Test of Homogeneity of Variances

# Homogeneity of Variance Plot

b. Why ANOVA test? Is there any other way to answer the above question?
Answer-
The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines 
whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other. 
Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis:

Friedman's Test is a fairly standard non-parametric statistic that's analogous to a repeated 
measures ANOVA. If null hypothesis is rejected, friedmanmc() function does post hoc analysis.
